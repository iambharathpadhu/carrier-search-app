# Carrier Search App for Freight Brokers

## ðŸ’¡ Outline

This project aims to provide a solution for freight brokers to select criteria for the best potential carrier and to select and book them for their transportation requirements. It includes a multi-step wizard that guides the user with a cool user experience, allowing users to filter carriers based on criteria and select the best potential match based on their requirements.

## Features

- Multi-step wizard for selecting criteria and carriers
- Filter carriers based on criteria such as rating, price range, special requirements, and on-time delivery percentage
- Cool user experience with animations and smooth transitions
- Utilizes URL state for preserving values even after refresh
- Built with Vite for fast bundling using Rollup, React Router Dom for navigation, Chakra UI for UI components, and Framer Motion for animations

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/iambharathpadhu/carrier-search-app.git

2. **Navigate to the repository:**
   ```sh
   cd carrier-search-app

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   

## Architecture

I chose to go with `react` as the framework of choice. The react code base has been scaffolded with vite and pnpm using:

```
npm create vite@latest
```

The app will have a single page with `/queries` route with `queryId` as an optional parameter.

I chose to split the screen into various components as follows:

The folder structure looks like this:

```
ðŸ’¡ All data is mocked on the front end. This app has no network layer.

In addition to the libraries already installed with the scaffolded app, here are some libraries that are being used:
| Library name                                  | Usage                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)       | An open-source component library optimized for fast development, easy maintenance, and accessibility. Just import and goâ€”no configuration required. |
| [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)                                               | For all animation needs                                                                 |
